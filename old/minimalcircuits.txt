it seems quite obvious that there must be lookuptables for which the minimal circuit has multiple steps. should be provable by enumeration

a next goal would be to prove that for any finite n, there is a lookuptable whose minimal circuit has (in the worst-case of lazy evaluation) n steps. not sure how to prove this, but maybe this becomes clearer after studying the enumerations.

this says nothing about p ?= np because it deals only with finite lookuptables
